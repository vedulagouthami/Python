        "9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "-Yes, lists in Python can contain different data types. Python lists are heterogeneous, meaning you can mix and match data types within a single list.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n",
        "-In Python, strings are immutable because once a string is created, its contents cannot be changed. Here's why this design choice is made and why it matters:\n",

        ".When you create a string in Python, the object is stored in memory with a specific value.\n",
        "\n",

        "-As of Python 3.7, dictionaries preserve insertion order as an official language feature:\n",
